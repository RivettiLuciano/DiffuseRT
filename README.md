# Diffuse-RT - Learning likely anatomical changes in radiation therapy

Diffuse-RT is a model that can be used to learn the underlying representation of the distribution of future anatomical changes. In our recent publication, we demonstrated how Diffuse-RT can predict likely anatomical changes in patients treated with head and neck radiotherapy over the course of their treatment. The model leverages denoised diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) to generate these predictions.
