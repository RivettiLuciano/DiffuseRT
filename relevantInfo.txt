# Potential code bases:

# For video's, also based on 3D convolutions
# https://github.com/lucidrains/video-diffusion-pytorch/blob/main/video_diffusion_pytorch/video_diffusion_pytorch.py

# For 3D medical data (I think a latent diffusion model)
# https://github.com/FirasGit/medicaldiffusion/blob/master/vq_gan_3d/model/vqgan.py 

# Many researchers rely on this one, but it is in 2D.
